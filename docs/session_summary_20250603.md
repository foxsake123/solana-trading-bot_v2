# Session Summary - June 3, 2025

## What We Accomplished
1. **Fixed Balance Tracking Issue**
   - Bot was showing 0.05 SOL instead of actual balance (9.05 SOL)
   - Fixed by preventing trader from overriding balance in simulation mode
   - Position sizes now calculate correctly

2. **Project Organization**
   - Cleaned up temporary files
   - Organized scripts into proper directories
   - Created comprehensive documentation




3. **Current Performance**
   - Win rate: ~76%
   - Risk/Reward: 2.43:1
   - Found trades with up to 8000%+ gains
   - Average position size now ~0.36 SOL (was 0.05 SOL)

## Technical Details
- Fixed in `trading_bot.py`: Added check to prevent balance override in simulation
- Balance syncs from database on startup
- Position sizing uses percentage of balance (3-5%)

## Additional Context from End of Session
    - Created mode-aware monitor (ultra_monitor_mode_aware.py) to show correct balance
    - Bot tested successfully in simulation (9.05 SOL balance)
    - Ready to start real trading with 1.0014 SOL
    - Monitor now detects which mode is active and shows appropriate balance
	
## Current Issue/Status
    - [If starting real trading]: "Started real trading and need help monitoring performance"
    - [If still testing]: "Need to verify real mode is working before going live"
