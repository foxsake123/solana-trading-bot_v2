Progress Summary
What We Accomplished Today

Fixed Birdeye API Integration ✅

Identified the issue: v3 endpoints don't exist, correct endpoints are /defi/tokenlist, /defi/price, etc.
Updated market_data.py with correct endpoints and proper error handling
Added DexScreenerAPI as fallback and MarketDataAggregator to combine sources
Bot now successfully discovers tokens (SOL, USDC, USDT, etc.) with real prices and volumes


Fixed Module Issues ✅

Repaired token_scanner.py after it was accidentally overwritten
Fixed import issues in enhanced_trading_bot.py
Corrected variable naming (scanner → token_scanner)


Current Status

Birdeye API: ✅ Working (finding tokens with correct data)
TokenScanner: ✅ Working (but TokenAnalyzer needs analyze method)
Enhanced Bot: ✅ Initializes successfully
Safety Manager: ❌ JSON file issue (easy fix with the script provided)
